### Hello there :wave:

I've been doing open-source work since 2002, my first contribution was a plugin to OSCommerce.  
Since 2009 I've been developing and maintaining Mobile Detect https://mobiledetect.net library.  
In my free time I'm working on a [game engine](https://github.com/serbanghita/gamedev) for [Isle of Dinosaurs 2D](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736290/Isle_of_Dinosaurs_2D/) and a [whiteboard](https://github.com/serbanghita/whiteboard) prototype, both written in Typescript with the help of ECS paradigm.  
You might also want to check [form-to-object](https://github.com/serbanghita/form-to-object) lib for convering a HTML form data to a JS multi-dimensional object. Hit me up if you want to include this in your library.
